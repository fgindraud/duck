Small collections of C++11/C++14 header only useful classes.
Placed under namespace `duck`.

Setup
-----

Header only, so no compilation is required.
A standard cmake setup is provided, which can compile and launch some tests.

Status
------

Currently completely work in progress.
TODO (completely out-of-date and not updated often):
- add license stuff and small doc in files.
- ranges:
	- expand std::algorithm version with ranges ?
	- more combinators ?
- formatter:
	- bad, generate too many types.
	- introduce piece-string system ?
